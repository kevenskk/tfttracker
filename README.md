TFT Tracker

A hobby project being developed leveraging the Riot API, the webapp allows the user to view any player's match history as well as their statistics (rank, win/loss percentage, top 4 rate, number of games played, etc.)
<br>
The frontend leverages React and Tailwind, furthermore the backend uses Node.js and Express.js as a proxy server to perform API calls to the Riot API for player information.
<br>
To be added - 
Caching player info so that it may be retrieved from a database instead of the Riot API.

The webapp can be found at - https://tfttracker.vercel.app/
